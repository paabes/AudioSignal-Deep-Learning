# Audio Signal Processing

This part of the project is dedicated to exploring different techniques for audio signal processing, including:

* Fast Fourier Transform
* Time-Frequency Analysis and Short-Time Fast Fourier Transform
* Mel-Frequency Coefficient Retrieval

**More detailed commentary is included with code in the Jupyter Notebook**



## Here are some extracts from plots obtained during signal analysis:
